## a little look at key entities in the actual code ##


firstly, objects are decided to either be randomized or procedurely created. 

'if(automatic):
	#// parse data and create archive,
	#// set empty shells of objects

else:
	#// randomize object queries
	#// use non default constructer to load custom attributes


#// then the action/ simulation here:

if(automatic):
	#// use an iterator to jump through the archive,
	#// this will connect 2 different arrays, 

	#// 1 to 1,	nextState = archive[currState]

	#// the smallest complexity.. hopefully bigO(0)
else:
	#// calculate the values, 
	#//  and/or store them
	#//  and/or plot them





if(not automatic):
	#// write to file here, to seed for later.


else:
	free memory i guess



'
now as we can see here, there are basially just 2 main sequence of events.




## compare it to the literal lines of code: ##
